# Portal-2-Your-Moms-House

This mod is not complete, its literally just a garbage dev map, and some ico files I made in ms paint.

It should be done in about a month if I care to finish it.

Updates will be posted when they're done.

To try out the map in its current form, open it by going to 'Portal 2 Authoring Tools' in steam, Clicking on 'Hammer Editor', Press 'File', Open the 'Portal 2 Your Mom's House' Folder, then click on 'File' and 'Run Map'

Make sure you have portal 2 installed, obviously.
